# Suspension Bridge Dynamics Simulation

This repository contains a Python simulation of a suspension bridge designed to analyse its dynamic behavior under varying loads.

The file `summative_assignment (7).pdf` contains the written report for this project. The other files contain the code snippets for different parts of the simulation.

## Project Overview
- Developed a **Python simulation** to study vertical and horizontal oscillations of a suspension bridge.
- Investigated **normal mode frequencies** and **resonance phenomena** under dynamic loading conditions.
- Applied **differential equations** and **eigenvalue analysis** to assess bridge stability and provide engineering insights.
- Designed to demonstrate the application of **mathematical modeling, computational simulation, and numerical analysis** in civil engineering.

## Key Features
- Models both **vertical and horizontal oscillations**.
- Calculates **normal modes** and identifies **resonance frequencies**.
- Outputs **time-series simulations** for dynamic loads.
- Uses Python libraries for computation and visualization (e.g., NumPy, Matplotlib).


## Skills Demonstrated
- Python programming and numerical simulation
- Differential equations and linear algebra (eigenvalue analysis)
- Data visualisation and interpretation
- Applied mathematics in engineering contexts
